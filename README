NOTE: GPP 2.1a is an incompletely documented and dead branch of the
GPP development tree.  Most of the differences from the previous
version, 2.1, are internal changes to speed up performance when
processing particularly complicated macros.  These changes will
probably eventually be merged with the main development tree (version
2.12 and beyond).

Unless you are using very tricky macros and are particularly concerned
about execution speed, you would probably be better off with one of
the stable, current releases.
